tidyCtrl is a package to help improve design of experiments (DOE) and analysis through strong test-control matching.  Picking better control cells for your test cells helps increase the robustness of any statistical test by improving the 1:n match.  This subsequently makes detecting effects due to a manipulation easier to read, if there is in fact an effect.
